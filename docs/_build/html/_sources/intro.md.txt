# Intallation

# Installation using ```poetry```

We use [```poetry```](https://python-poetry.org/docs/), a tool for dependency management and packaging in python to install the benchmarking framework. You can install ```poetry``` following the steps described [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation). 
In order to install the benchmarking tool, open a terminal in the directory where you clone the benchmark (or use the console in your preferred IDE). Then, make ```poetry``` create a virtual environment and install all the current dependencies of the benchmark using:

```bash
poetry install
```
